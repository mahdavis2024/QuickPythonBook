Lab 9: Useful functions
Looking back at the labs in chapters 6 and 7 , refactor that code into functions for
cleaning and processing the data.
The goal should be that most of the logic is moved into functions. 
Use your own judgment as to the types of functions and parameters, but
keep in mind that functions should do just one thing, and they shouldnâ€™t have any side
effects that carry over outside the function.
