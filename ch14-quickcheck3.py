'''Quick Check: Context managers
Assume that youâ€™re using a context manager in a script that reads and/or writes several
files. Which of the following approaches do you think would be best?

A) Put the entire script in a block managed by a with statement.
B) Use one with statement for all file reads and another for all file writes.
C) Use a with statement each time you read a file or write a file (for each line, for example).
D) Use a with statement for each file that you read or write.'''

D makes more sense.
