'''
Lab 12: More file operations
How might you calculate the total size of all files ending with .txt that arenâ€™t symlinks in
a directory? If your first answer was using os.path, also try it with pathlib, and vice versa.
Write some code that builds off your solution to move the same .txt files in the lab
question to a new subdirectory called backup in the same directory.
