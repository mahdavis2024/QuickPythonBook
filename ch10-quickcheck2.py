'''Quick Check: Namespaces and scope
Consider a variable width thatâ€™s in the module make_window.py. In which of the
following contexts is width in scope?:
(A) within the module itself
(B) inside the resize() function in the module
(C) within the script that imported the make_window.py module'''

#width is in scope of A the module itself and B the function is the module that uses it.
#but not is the scope of the code that imported the module.
